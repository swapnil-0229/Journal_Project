Journal Application API
A robust backend application for a personal journaling service, built with Java and the Spring Boot framework. This project provides a secure RESTful API for user authentication and full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for journal entries, using MongoDB as the database.

Features
Secure User Authentication: Employs Spring Security for user registration and login. Passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt.

RESTful API: A well-structured API for managing users and their journal entries.

User-Specific Data: Journal entries are linked to individual user accounts, ensuring data privacy.

MongoDB Integration: Uses Spring Data MongoDB for seamless interaction with a NoSQL database.

Transactional Operations: Ensures data integrity when saving or deleting entries linked to a user.

Health Check Endpoint: A simple endpoint to verify the application's operational status.

Tech Stack
Framework: Spring Boot

Language: Java 8

Security: Spring Security

Build Tool: Apache Maven

Utilities: Lombok

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or newer

Apache Maven

A running instance of MongoDB

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd journal-app

Create the application.properties file:
For security, the configuration file containing database credentials is not included in the repository. You must create it manually.

Create a new file named application.properties inside the src/main/resources/ directory.

Add the following configuration, replacing the placeholder with your MongoDB connection string and desired database name.

# MongoDB Connection String
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/journaldb

# Server Port (Optional)
server.port=8080

Build the project using the Maven Wrapper:
This command will download dependencies and compile the source code.

# For macOS/Linux
./mvnw clean install

# For Windows
./mvnw.cmd clean install

Run the application:

java -jar target/journal-app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The application will start, and the API will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
